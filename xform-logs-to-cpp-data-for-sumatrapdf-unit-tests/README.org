* Transform log files into static data for unit tests

I'm developing a patch for sumatrapdf.  I had prepared
some log files of the old behavior to demonstrate it and
to check for regressions.  My patch got rejected because
they did not want external files, so I want to encode the
same info as static data in the C++ source code.

This is a parser for these log files.  I am not concerned
about error recovery: the log files are well-formed.
