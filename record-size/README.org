* record-size

Guess the record size from data
- Input is a block of bytes (up to 1MiB)
- There is no separator between records, they are all of the same unknown length
- Input length is not necessarily a multiple of the record length
- Input can be ASCII (text or numeric), EBCDIC (text or numeric), ...
- Each record contains at least one numeric and one text field
