#+TITLE: SimulEpargneLongTerme

* Purpose

Simulate long term saving with fiscal advantage to estimate its net
interest rate.  The assumptions are:
- There is a normal savings account with a low interest rate, from which
  all long term deposits are taken.  This normal account is topped up
  with `external' money on an as-needed basis.
- The long term account has a slightly higher interest rate, but still
  rather low.
- The main gains are expected to be due to the tax returns.

The benchmark to estimate the net interest rate is to take the same
inputs to the normal savings account needed during the simulation and
compound them at a fixed interest rate (higher than the long term saving
account's rate).

Hence the strategy is to use the tax return of one year to pay part
of the deposit of the next.  Also, as soon as funds are allowed to be
taken out of long term saving (after 10 years), take out what is needed
to pay the rest of the long term deposit.  This limits external input to
the normal savings account and thus the amount of money blocked on a low
interest rate account.  Only what is needed it taken out because the long
term saving account's interest rate is higher than the normal account.

Note that this simulation is still slightly biased in favor of the
benchmark: if the assumed high fixed rate investment used as benchmark is
available, we could take out the money after 10 years that is not needed
for next year's deposit and put in the same investment, improving the
return of the scheme under test.  This would be slightly more complicated
without gaining a lot of compelling advantage. so I didn't do it.

* Example run for cbf51fed15ba5ce6ce7ce1e919d7c691e41604d0

#+begin_example
  ----- Born 1977-01-01, starting 2019-10-01 -----
  final total == 35734.64 on 2044-12-31
  fixed 2.9%-> 35237.78
  fixed 3.0%-> 35986.58
  fixed 3.1%-> 36750.88
  fixed 3.2%-> 37530.98
#+end_example

So we can say that the proposed scheme is equivalent to an interest rate
of between 2.9% and 3.0%.

The logging output has been reformatted and augmented with running
totals of both accounts during manual validation of the output.

* Further questions
** TODO check taxation at 60
Currently (cbf51fed15ba5ce6ce7ce1e919d7c691e41604d0), taxation is on
value on 60th birthday, without taking penalizing for taking money out
before.  If it really is the case that there is no penalty for taking
money (that is older than 10 years) out before 60th birthday, do it to
reduce the taxation.

** TODO update with current interest rates

** TODO sensitivity analysis
What happens if long term interest rates drop to 0.5%?
