#+TITLE: Query Have I Been Pwned?
#+AUTHOR: Philippe Crama

* Introduction
HaveIBeenPwned.com allows to query if a user ID or a password has been exposed
during a data breach.  This tool parses ~.netrc~ files for a list of
credentials to check.

This project is also an exercise in Haskell to produce source code that is
easily audited: the goal is to demonstrate easily that the program does not
steal your credentials.

* Structure
** Guaranteeing the tool cannot leak passwords
Wrap the password in a ~newtype~ with a custom ~Show~ instance that only
prints ~*~ and only allows to compare against a given SHA1 and to extract
the first 3 bytes of the SHA1.

This leaves the parsing code that must wrap the secrets as soon as possible.

      scheme :: Maybe Text
    , machine :: Text
    , login :: Text
    , account :: Maybe Password
    , password :: Password
  } deriving (Show, Eq)
